# Todo List

## In Progress


- investigate if we can do more with hummingbird search results
- update subscription data UI separately from actual data update on backend (same with search ui)

- use highcharts instead of d3 for charting

- do proper subscription loading…
- Create a search page (similar to myspace!)
- import collection (UI work + fileupload)

- owl carousel for discover page

- fix images that get blurry because of webkit animations
- only have the friend search source be loaded once during the session! Store it in a `Session` variable or something…

## Backlog
- look into a similar style as Myspace!!! https://myspace.com/ryanjamesmusic
- look into additional reports: 
http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/reports.php

- interest level for backlogged animes
- Recommend animes based on the actualy name of the anime (maybe in activity subpage???) [eg. bleach movies]
- create controls for `Social Subpage`
- conceptualize a proper filter system and UI
- create module in admin panel to manage friendship states

## Completed

- convert all `''` to `""` without breakages

- hover events for music subpage
- variable for sans serif font replace all older instances of `Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial`
- generalize colors for info bar into variables.less (and all corresponding subpages)
- fix the `infoBar` footers so that they don’t stay visible when the `infoBar` is hidden (deal with this problem in the `infoBar` rework task)

- Resolve duplicate named entries and add year to name to clarify (do this at the server level)
- change `social` to `friends`
- change all buttons to be less ugly! (more like Treehouse)
- change font to Gotham Rounded A
- infobar navbar should be raised buttons
- fix image scaling (see fighting spirit)
- do a cool slide in thing for all page switches (like when we have the sidebar minified)
- transition search group hover color changes
